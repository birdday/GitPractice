# READ ME
Hey! Practice using git and github with this repo. I would not store anything important here. 

Consider updating this README with notes on git, or whatever else you think should go here.
Also, don't forget to get into the habit of adding comments/titles to commits.

Good luck and enjoy!

I'm modifiying my github files locally from terminal.
Check using git status to see what there is too commit.
